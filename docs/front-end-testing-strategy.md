# Frontend Testing Strategy

## Frontend Testing Strategy

- **Component Testing:** **Jest** and **React Testing Library** will be used to test individual components in isolation. Focus will be on rendering, props, and user interactions.
- **UI Integration/Flow Testing:** React Testing Library will also be used to test small user flows composed of multiple components. API calls will be mocked using **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**.
- **End-to-End UI Testing:** **Playwright** will be used to run automated tests on critical user journeys (e.g., the full purchase flow) in a real browser environment.

## Testing Pyramid Approach

The frontend testing strategy follows a testing pyramid approach:

### Unit Testing (Base)

- **Framework:** Jest + React Testing Library
- **Scope:** Individual components and utility functions
- **Focus:** Component rendering, props validation, user interactions
- **Coverage:** High coverage for reusable components

### Integration Testing (Middle)

- **Framework:** React Testing Library + MSW
- **Scope:** Component interactions and API integration
- **Focus:** User flows, state management, API mocking
- **Coverage:** Critical user journeys and feature workflows

### End-to-End Testing (Top)

- **Framework:** Playwright
- **Scope:** Complete user journeys
- **Focus:** Real browser testing, cross-browser compatibility
- **Coverage:** Critical business flows (checkout, authentication)

## Testing Tools and Configuration

### Jest Configuration

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/src/setupTests.ts"],
  moduleNameMapping: {
    "^@/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/src/$1",
  },
  collectCoverageFrom: ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx}", "!src/**/*.d.ts"],
};
```

### React Testing Library Setup

```typescript
// src/setupTests.ts
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
import { server } from "./mocks/server";

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

### Playwright Configuration

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default {
  testDir: "./tests/e2e",
  use: {
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    trace: "on-first-retry",
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Testing Best Practices

### Component Testing Guidelines

- Test component rendering with different props
- Test user interactions (clicks, form submissions)
- Test error states and loading states
- Use semantic queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Avoid testing implementation details

### API Mocking Strategy

- Use MSW for API mocking in tests
- Create realistic mock responses
- Test error handling scenarios
- Mock authentication tokens and headers

### Accessibility Testing

- Include accessibility testing in component tests
- Use jest-axe for automated accessibility checks
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
