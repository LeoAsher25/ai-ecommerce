Based on the brief, I propose the following five Epics for our Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

Epic: Core E-commerce Engine

Description: This covers all the fundamental functionality a customer needs to buy a product. It includes Browse the product catalog, viewing product details, adding items to a cart, and completing the checkout process.

Epic: User Account & Profile

Description: This encompasses everything related to the user. It covers registration, login/logout, password management, and a profile section where users can view their order history and manage their personal information.

Epic: The 'Perfect Fit' Finder

Description: This is our key differentiator. This Epic will cover the design, development, and integration of the interactive quiz that guides parents to the perfect bicycle for their child.

Epic: Site Administration Portal

Epic: Safety & Content Hub

Description: This covers the creation and management of the static informational pages, such as the "About Us" page and the various safety guides and articles that will build trust with your audience.
