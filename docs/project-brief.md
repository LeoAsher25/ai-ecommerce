# Project Brief: {Project Name - TBD}

## Introduction / Problem Statement

Parents face significant challenges when buying bicycles for their children. Their primary concerns are **safety** and **choosing the correct size**, which often leads to a lack of confidence in purchasing online. They worry about buying a bike that their child will quickly outgrow or that isn't appropriate for their skill level. This uncertainty can paralyze the buying decision or lead to post-purchase dissatisfaction. Our goal is to create an e-commerce experience that eliminates this uncertainty and positions our brand as the most trusted expert in children's bicycles.

## Vision & Goals

- **Vision:** To be the most trusted and parent-friendly online destination for children's bicycles, transforming a confusing purchase into a confident and joyful experience.
- **Primary Goals (MVP):**
  1.  **Build Trust through Expertise:** Launch an interactive "Perfect Fit Finder" to guide parents to the ideal bike, increasing purchase confidence and reducing returns.
  2.  **Establish a Foundational E-commerce Platform:** Create a complete, from-scratch e-commerce system (User Site, Admin Site, Backend) that can manage inventory from the physical store, process orders, and handle payments securely.
  3.  **Promote Safety as a Core Value:** Integrate safety information and accessory recommendations (helmets, pads) seamlessly into the shopping experience.

## Target Audience / Users

The primary target audience is **parents and guardians of children** (approximately ages 3-12). They may have limited knowledge about bicycles but are highly invested in their child's safety and happiness. They are looking for guidance, quality, and a trustworthy retailer.

## Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)

- **E-commerce Core:**
  - Product listings with detailed specifications, images, and videos.
  - Inventory management synced with the physical store.
  - Secure shopping cart and checkout process.
  - User account creation and order history.
- **"Perfect Fit Finder":** An interactive quiz that asks for a child's age, height, and experience level to recommend the top 2-3 bikes.
- **Admin Control Panel:**
  - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products, categories, and inventory.
  - Order management and fulfillment tracking.
  - Content management for safety guides and articles.
  - Management of the "Perfect Fit Finder" logic and recommendations.
- **Safety Hub:** A dedicated section with articles and guides on bike safety. Safety accessory bundles will be offered on product pages.

## Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas

- **"Customization Station":** Allow users to add decals (like a child's name) and select from a pre-set list of accessories (baskets, bells) on the product page.
- **"Grow With Me" Trade-Up Program:** A loyalty program integrated with the physical store, allowing customers to trade in outgrown bikes for credit towards a new one.
- Advanced community features like a gallery of "happy riders" or a forum for parents.

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

- The entire system (Backend, Admin Site, User Site) must be built from scratch, replacing the previous WordPress site.
- The solution must integrate with the inventory of the existing physical store.
- The final solution should be robust, scalable, and easy for non-technical staff to manage via the Admin Site.

## PM Prompt

This Project Brief provides the full context for our new Children's Bicycle E-commerce Platform. Please start in 'PRD Generation Mode', review the brief thoroughly, and work with the user to create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
