## Dev Technical Guidance

### Architecture Context

This story implements the core product browsing functionality using our established architecture patterns. Reference the following documents for implementation details:

- **Frontend Architecture**: See `docs/font-end-architecture.md#Component-Architecture` for component patterns
- **State Management**: See `docs/front-end-state-management.md` for Redux Toolkit and TanStack Query patterns
- **API Integration**: See `docs/front-end-api-interaction.md` for service layer patterns
- **Styling**: See `docs/front-end-style-guide.md` for Tailwind CSS implementation

### Data Models

Use the Product and Category models defined in `docs/data-models.md`:

- Product interface includes: id, name, description, price, images, categoryId, isActive
- Category interface includes: id, name, description, parentId, image

### API Endpoints

Reference `docs/api-reference.md` for the following endpoints:

- `GET /products` - List products with pagination and filtering
- `GET /categories` - List categories for navigation
- `GET /categories/:id/products` - Get products by category

### Component Structure

Follow the project structure defined in `docs/project-structure.md`:

- Create components in `src/components/Shop/`
- Use feature-based organization in `src/features/products/`
- Implement services in `src/services/`

### Performance Requirements

- Product listing loads within 2 seconds (see `docs/operational-guidelines.md#Performance-Guidelines`)
- Images optimized using Next.js Image component
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries

### Mobile Responsiveness

- Grid adapts to mobile screens using Tailwind responsive classes
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile interaction
- Optimize for mobile performance and usability

### SEO Considerations

- Implement proper meta tags for category pages
- Use SEO-friendly URLs for product and category pages
- Add structured data for product listings
